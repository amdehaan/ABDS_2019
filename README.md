## Lab instructions

To complete the labs run all demos and exercises in the right order from 0 -> in each available lab. Each lab is also numbered, so run them in the right order (from low to high).

Demos are explanations of theory and code examples to complete the lab exercises.

When required in the Excercise, upload the requested files (usually 1 Rmd and 1 html (rendered Rmd)) per exercise to the Advanced Bioinformatics & Data Science CANVAS site (Module 2 - BIOC).

GOOD LUCK! and do not hesitate to ask questions.

Do not forget: Google and Stack Overflow are your best friends when programming in R.
